### Hi there! 😁

My name is Petherson Moreno from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Developer since 2007 and currently I'm Front-End Developer at [inGaia](http://ingaia.com.br/). I love javascript, open source projects, DEVOPS and software architecture.

My free time I like to play with my son and my wife.

Would you like to find me?
